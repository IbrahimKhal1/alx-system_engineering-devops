0x19. Postmortem
Issue Summary
On March 3, 2025, from 02:15 AM to 04:45 AM UTC, our web application experienced a major outage that affected our real-time monitoring dashboard. Approximately 40% of our users encountered slow response times and intermittent connectivity issues. The root cause was identified as a misconfigured load balancer combined with an unpatched memory leak in our server application. This failure not only disrupted user experience but also led to delays in processing critical data, impacting our operational metrics.

Timeline
02:15 AM UTC: The incident was first detected by our automated monitoring system, which triggered an alert due to unusually high response times.
02:18 AM UTC: An engineer noticed the spike in error logs and immediately began initial diagnostics.
02:25 AM UTC: The team investigated the load balancer settings and suspected a misconfiguration, but initial assumptions pointed to potential network congestion.
02:35 AM UTC: Customer complaints began arriving via our support channels, confirming that the issue was widespread.
02:45 AM UTC: Further investigation revealed an unpatched memory leak in our server code, which was causing increased load and subsequent failure of the load balancer.
03:00 AM UTC: The incident was escalated to the senior DevOps team, who took control of the situation.
03:30 AM UTC: A temporary fix was deployed by rebalancing the traffic and restarting the affected server instances.
04:15 AM UTC: The load balancer was reconfigured with updated parameters, and the patch for the memory leak was applied.
04:45 AM UTC: Normal service resumed as the system stabilized.
Root Cause and Resolution
The outage was primarily caused by a cascading failure where an unpatched memory leak in the server application led to resource exhaustion, which in turn caused the load balancer to misroute incoming traffic. The initial investigation focused on potential network issues, leading to a delay in identifying the actual source of the problem. Once the memory leak was discovered, corrective measures were immediately taken by patching the code and reconfiguring the load balancer to better handle unexpected loads. The combined effort of rebalancing traffic and applying the patch resulted in a swift restoration of services.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent similar outages in the future, the following actions will be implemented:

Code Patching and Review:
Patch the identified memory leak and conduct a comprehensive code review to identify other potential vulnerabilities.
Enforce stricter coding standards and regular security audits.
Load Balancer Optimization:
Reconfigure the load balancer settings to automatically adjust to spikes in traffic.
Implement automated tests to validate load balancer configuration changes before deployment.
Enhanced Monitoring:
Deploy more granular monitoring tools to detect resource leaks early.
Set up alerts for anomalous memory usage and load patterns.
Incident Response Training:
Schedule regular incident response drills to ensure the team is well-prepared.
Document and review the postmortem process to refine troubleshooting protocols.
On a lighter note, while we take these incidents seriously, weâ€™ve learned that even a perfectly crafted code can have an off day. Moving forward, these measures will ensure that our system remains robust and resilient against unexpected challenges.
